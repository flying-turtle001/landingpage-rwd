## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) - JS framework
- [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/) - Vue framework
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### What I learned

The tasks in this project were very diverse. Before I could start programming the landing page, it was first of all important to deal intensively with the concrete task.

My first task was to decide on a product and a brand context in which I wanted to place the product. I decided on donuts as the product and wanted to place them in the brand context of the company [SCUF](https://scufgaming.com/de).

Next, I designed several wireframes to get a first impression of the content and its placement on the landing page.
After that I created high fidelity screen designs for desktop and mobile devices. I created the wireframes as well as the screen designs in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/).

After the preliminary work was done, I started developing the landing page. Being a big fan of modern frontend frameworks, I decided to use [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/) for the development to deepen and improve my knowledge.

For the styling of the individual components and content I used [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

I developed the landing page from scratch using the mobile first approach.

In addition, I photographed and staged all the donuts placed on the landing page myself.

During the development, the component-based development approach was very important to me.

To give the landing page more dynamic and to practice working with third party packages, I placed a 360 degree rotatable donut in the hero section. For this I used [vue-product-spinner](https://github.com/micheleriva/vue-product-spinner).
For the different sliders on the landing page I used [vue-awesome-swiper](https://github.com/surmon-china/vue-awesome-swiper).

All in all, I was able to learn and deepen many things and workflows during the project work and at the same time I was able to deepen my knowledge in Vue, Nuxt and Tailwind CSS.
